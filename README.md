# Boids
Python code for boid AI

This is an example simulation for boid behaviour, the code attatched includes an object oriented approach to implement boids with separation, cohesion and alignment behaviours. In order to run this code you will need the libraries: pygame, math and random. On my machine this program runs best at ~70 boids.
